I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.\\n·ç® The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).\\n·ç® Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.\\n·ç® The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.\\n·ç® I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.\\n·ç® There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.\\n\\n-------------------------\\nüíñ WHAT I LIKED\\n-------------------------\\n‚óæ The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.\\n‚óæ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.\\n‚óæ IPX68 dust and waterproof.\\n‚óæ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring\\n‚óæ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n‚ôªÔ∏è WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n‚óæ More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.\\n‚óæ Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.\\n\\n-------------------\\nüç± OVERALL\\n-------------------\\nThe MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. ü•á\\nRead more\",\n",

It's sound quality is like best at its price segment and better than high priced product too.\\nIt fits into the ear like perfect fitting. It will not come out even you swing your head hardly.\\nIt has a decent look that doesn't even get noticed like very subtle.\\nIts mic quality is also decent.\\nAnd now for what you have come so far\\nCons:\\nIt shows of having a battery life upto 8 hours but it doesn't giving even 5 hours of continuous use.\\nIts bluetooth connectivity is also poor. It's connection get blocked by a single wall. That means you can't use it in your home but if you use it in open place,you will get a range of 10 m.\\nIts mic sound get distortion at the other end when you are on a call.\\nIt got a very bad phrases which interupt your music which I heard most people are complaining.\\nIt got some bad software sync with your phone. Like you charged it, you are using it and it doesn't show a battery drop after use and you think that it giving a great battery life but its not. That level drop drastically like from 100 to 50 directly and then you think that its a defected piece but its not. So this is also a issue.\\nAnd at last, when you are on call it cut little sound from the other side like blocking signals. Its the earphone issue.\\n\\nNow conclusion,\\nIf you want to get a great sounding earphone, go for 550 pro/sport which come at same price.\\nAll in one word, I am not recommending these as you can't buy this only for sound.\\nAnd you can get my point from the above mentioned issues.\\n\\nHope ypu liked the review.\\nThanks\\nRead more\",\n",

To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI.

They will never reach to you, you will try to reach them using their customer care number but believe me they will never attend your call. Now how i am saying this i will tell you.
